It's not entirely clear how much a difference hospitalization will make on the mortality rate. But it is also possible that the measures we all take will cause as much, or more, harm for society as a whole.\n\nFar too many people's livelihoods are directly tied to their ability to go out and work. Most Americans can't survive a few weeks without work to self quarantine. Companies are cancelling events. For hourly people that's basically the same as a pay cut or a layoff. Companies, some of them, are starting to fire people. Many are pausing hiring. People will lose their homes and take on excessive debt to try and keep food on the table.\n\nMaybe I'm cynical, but I strongly expect that, in the end, there will be little difference in the percentage infected/mortality rate when comparing different locations responses to the disease and areas with the most aggressive policies designed to prevent the spread of the disease will be worse off for their efforts. The curves might look different, but so will the amount of time the area spends taking these measures.\n\nTime will tell. I'll gladly admit if the evidence shows I'm wrong.",

We've been getting a lot of new customers all of a sudden. I'm sure from further areas since some food/supplies aren't guaranteed at a lot of locations anymore. We're doing 3x the normal sales I've been told. We can't keep up. We ran out of ground beef, chicken, bread, tp, sanitizer, and lot more (although some things were restocked a day or so later). I'm sure our suppliers are having a hard time keeping up with all this food hoarding/panic buying. People flooded the liquor store next to us as well. I've never seen anything like this. We're a 24 hour store, but we've been closing the doors from 9pm-6am. Turns out it made for a lot of frustrated/angry customers. Some probably went hungry for the night. I've seen a lot of people put their dirty sanitary wipes inside the cart's cup holder instead of tossing it in the trash. I still notice people not washing their hands after using the restroom, touching their face, etc. They are the lazy, inconsiderate ones that are going to help spread the virus. Some few customers have worn masks and/or gloves but it seems like not many are taking this  seriously. I wash my hands a lot, so that's a no-brainer for me. I also go through a ton of gloves at my job. I've been even more cautious with how I operate at work. Seems like the cashiers would be most at risk since they touch so many items, cash, and rewards cards. Everybody should be wearing gloves and changing them often. From what I've seen, we're probably doomed if people don't change up their bad habits and change them quick.....",

SARS was deadly, bit it killed so fast, there wasn't chance to spread out.

They can be pushed shut if necessary with elbows, shoulders or even a gentle nudge with a knee or hip.\n\nSome personal thoughts: Since no one knows how long COVID-19 lives outside the human body on surfaces, etc. It is probably wise to change clothing often and wash it. Change clothes after being in crowds, etc.\n\nAlso personally, I have very long hair which I shampoo a couple times a week. I am wondering if covering hair that cannot be shampooed every day is a good idea? A scarf or other cap completely covering long hair could be laundered or even discarded if it was like the paper surgical caps used in hospitals. If virus particles are viable a long time on surfaces (nobody seems to know, but...), and if there were viable particles in the hair and a person snuggled in the blankets and pillows in bed...and hair fell across the face, etc....it might not be too good.",

Since, for most people, the symptoms are similar to a cold, most people won't ever get tested. This means that a lot more people have the virus than is being reported. And this means that the kill rate is a lot lower than is being reported.\n\nMasks don't protect you, they prevent water droplets from leaving the person wearing the mask. If you're not coughing or sneezing then don't wear a mask. Consider someone sneezes near you. If water droplets from the sneezing person hit your face you can wipe them off. But if you're wearing a mask those droplets will be in front of your nose all day long.\n\nFinally, and this should be the standard regardless of the virus of the year, wash your hands, cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze, stay home when your sick. I know that last one is hard for people barely earning enough to live. So look at your life and do what you have to do to get a job with paid sick leave. Don't think it's impossible for you. It isn't. \n\nThe Government is not going to save you. They can't. No matter how much of our money they throw at this. The world is not conspiring against Trump.

He told me he did want to see me and to make an appointment which I did. Shortly after his nurse called and said when I got there to call from the parking lot and someone would come down and swab me for the flu. I asked if they had any test kits for Coronavirus. They did not. My doctor's office is a big one by Baylor Scott & White in downtown Dallas. I told him I did not feel that it was necessary for me to be swabbed for the flu as I had no fever and no flu symptoms and that I would continue over the counter medication and try to get in with an allergy doctor. Shortly after my doctor called and offered to call in some antibiotic for a sinus infection since I had listed all of my symptoms and he agreed that is what I had. I have no idea why I was being asked to come in and get swabbed for the flu and not even see the doctor. I'm wondering what I would do if I did have Coronavirus. Would I go straight to ER?

I may sound like an asshole and you\u2019re right, but half of it is showing that people with the virus (especially KIDS IN A JR HIGH) won\u2019t immediately die, and also because I want revenge on the retarded kids for possibly getting me sick.           *STORY TIME*   I had a friend named Heiu, he was nice until I realized he\u2019s a dweeb, he has friended I kid you not most of not all misfits in the school, you name it.  Losers, retarded kids who attend reg. classes but have something wrong, actual support center kids who have attempted to escape the school at least twice, gays who abuse the title \u201cgay\u201d and only use it for attention, freaks, goths, nerds, dweebs, weebs, annoying kids, and me, an innocent person who is now scared to make a new \u201cfriend\u201d because of past experiences.  anyways, he\u2019s friends with a kid named Dale.  Dale is rather slow.  He attends honor classes but in last years honor math, a problem shown on the projector showed a picture of a 3D box with a poorly drawn spider inside for the Pythagorean Theorem.  He took one look at the FAKE DRAWN SPIDER, HURDLES A 70$ CALCULATOR OWNED BY THE SCHOOL AT THE GROUND, CURLS UP IN A BALL AND BEGINS AN EPISODE!  in the end be got off scot free but people who pay taxes (my parents and other people who don\u2019t want to cheat the IRS or whatever) got to pay for it.         Well, I sat at a specific table in a specific spot for the whole first semester, dale sits directly in front of me, hieu diangle, and my friend Rogan to my left.  when dale coughs, he doesn\u2019t cover it.  Instead, he suddenly yet slightly leans forward and always coughs twice, most likely hurling a few tiny droplets of cancer inches away from my phone.       well, corona got really bad last week, and he\u2019s been gone since.  *im thinking that he possibly has/had corona or some bug and I\u2019ve been sitting in front of him accepting his diseases for a whole four months!*     I can\u2019t tell my friend hieu because he\u2019s clingy, he sees me as a \u201cbeeest\u201d friend (I\u2019m asking for help please hear my crys) and does not see any problem with dale or his friends whatsoever.  dale ran away twice from my 2nd period in one semester.  the first time, a Russian kid accidentally called him dillan, dale got up and screamed in his face and ran out the portable.  the second time, he called a *colored* girl a BURNT POTATO (skin color people skin color) and ran off.  so yea he\u2019s an ass I hope you all see why I want to take him and his friends down with me if I get the virus.\n              I never expected to write a small essay as a random comment but I think I did it because I need to vent and explain why I need help now I can\u2019t deal with it anymore someone pleas link a psychological help subreddit or something I\u2019m begging you",

The death rate is only this high because we arent doing proper testing where we need to. Once that is figured out the death rate will be significantly lower than its being said it is now. I can say this with certainty because the H1N1 is still a firm memory i have of people panicking over a flu that didnt have a vaccine that many people died from over a short period of time. But had moreso higher death rate at the beginning of the period then towards the end when testing became more prevalent. People that are immunocompromised still die to it even with the vaccine. Which is tragic but an unfortunate reality for medicine.\n\nI dont get how saying its like the flu means you wouldnt take it seriously, you should always take precautions when it comes to potential diseases. Which is why I dont get how people are getting annoyed when someones like \"well i mean its basically a flu\", thats not saying they wont take precautions thats them saying theyre not going to freak out over it because panic does nothing. And it also shares a lot of symptoms with the flu. It's not the flu but its similar to one so people put it into that category. \n\nPeople who say there is no illness whatsoever and denying the existence of an illness are the problem, people who think it'll go away on its own and never come back are the problem (advocating that there doesnt need to be a vaccine for it). People who overstock on items because they're freaking out are the problem.",

But at times its hard to know if it's being rigorous and accurate or a bit alarmist.\n\nThere's one section in particular that touches on something I've been thinking about too:\n\n*In the early days of the infection, many outside observers were highly skeptical of the Chinese numbers, and thought that they might hide magnitudes of undetected mild and asymptomatic cases, which means that the mortality is much lower than reported. The WHO delegation to China, led by Bruce Aylward, found this not to be the case. Aylward maintains that once enough resources were available, the Chinese testing was very thorough and only a fraction of infected cases have been missed. (Even mild and asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 are infectious, so they matter.)*\n\nNo links are provided... Does anyone know whether this is the case? Is the doctor just pushing back against complacency maybe? \n\nWhenever I have heard about testing, it has been either done to people with symptoms, or proximity to someone with symptoms, or in some cases through self selection (like the drive up places in Korea and elsewhere).\n\nThat seems to me like it must skew against the mildest and most asymptomatic cases. Even the fact the mortality rate is much lower in Korea (0.6%) where testing has been widest seems to imply this, and that properly randomised testing would produce an even higher estimate of population wide infections and a still lower mortality rate?\n\nApparently, according to this article, there is also a lower mortality rate in China, outside Wuhan, because they are better prepared... But wouldn't being better prepared include testing more aggressively earlier when the infected population is smaller, and so easier to saturate, leaving more tests available for less symptomatic cases?\n\nHave I misunderstood how the testing is being conducted? \n\nIf not, how can anything but properly randomised testing not over-count more serious cases, which are obviously more likely to get testing done when test kits are being assigned by priority?\n\nThat doesn't make it any less scary, since a higher infection rate times a lower mortality rate can still equal the same death-toll as the inverse...",

I know it is from a person eating an infected animal but people have always eaten animals since the beginning of time. Why all the sudden, does this virus start spreading like a wild fire?  Is it because the meat wasn't cooked all the way and if so, how can that be because people have eaten raw food for years? One minute I just feel so confident that it will just pass us by and no one in our community will get the Coronavirus but then I learned on the news that we have a confirmed case of the Coronavirus of an employee that works here in Jefferson County but lives in Albany. I guess I knew it was coming but was not ready to accept it. The other night when I heard the news that our state had the highest confirmed cases in the country, I broke down and cried and reality hit me. Being humble is the part we must play to be strong for others around us, however I know what is in store for every community in the country. How many people will actually stay home to slow down the spread of the virus? We could get ahead of the problem if we just all work together and remember that we are strong enough to handle anything that strikes in our lives. After they closed the schools for an entire month along with many other businesses, it felt like we were in one of the zombie movies you watch on television. I still can not even believe this is happening. Our family made plans to join the gym and start going on a regular basis as soon as we got a minute, only to learn that the idea is out of the question. We planned on spending our son's birthday at the movies, that is also out of the question. We just went ice skating and planned on going again very soon but also out of the question. We wanted to go watch a play called \"Mary Poppins\" at the school but can not do that either. I can not even visit my parents because they were exposed to my sister who visited a man in NYC for the night. I know I have no right to complain because others have faced much worse than we have but I am so lost and would just look forward to turning on the news to hear them say that the virus has disappeared and we are all going to be okay. Each and every one of us around the globe have a story to tell. This virus is deadlier than a tornado. I pray for every community that we find a way to kick the Coronavirus to the curb.",

They explicitly mention the importance of airborne precautions in which very small particles spread in the air. The epidemiologic data continue to point to airborne transmission being the driver of the COVID-19 outbreak. The immune response to COVID-19 is not yet understood.\n\nThe researchers found instances when viral nucleotide was present in anal swabs or blood samples even when oral swabs tested negative.\n\nInfected patients can potentially shed this pathogen through respiratory, fecal\u2013oral, or body fluid routes.\n\nWhile the data have not yet been published, and should therefore be interpreted with caution, this non-randomised, unblinded study showed a strong reduction in viral load with hydroxychloroquine.\nAfter 6 days, the percentage of patients testing positive for COVID-19 who received hydroxychloroquine fell to 25% versus 90% for those who did not receive the treatment (a group of untreated COVID-19 patients from Nice and Avignon). In addition, comparing untreated patients, those receiving hydroxychloroquine and those given hydroxychloroquine plus the antibiotic azithromycin, the results showed there was \"a spectacular reduction in the number of positive cases\" with the combination therapy, said Prof Raoult.\n\nThere have been positive results in an in vitro study and a preliminary Chinese study in 100 patients which showed that hydroxychloroquine reduced the viral load, the symptoms lasted for less time, and they are not as severe. This could reduce the number of carriers, which I find interesting from an epidemiological perspective.\n\nRemdesivir has been used in a few patients on a compassionate-use basis outside of a clinical trial setting. \"It's a nucleotide analogue, and like other drugs of that class, it disrupts nucleic acid production. Some data suggest that it might have some efficacy.\n\n\nOthers may develop sepsis or a syndrome of multisystem organ failure with renal and endothelial collapse, making it difficult to maintain blood pressure. Like with so many pathologies, it is a vicious circle in which everything gets overworked. Off-and-on treatments can sometimes break the cycle: supplementary oxygen, giving red blood cells, dialysis. We support those functions while waiting for healing to occur.",

I'd like to know how I'm supposed to pay my rent and take care of my aging parent when I can't go to work and am not getting a paycheck. Precautions can and should be taken. The elderly and other high risk individuals should be staying at home, away from other people if possible (not everyone lives with their parents and grandparents) and  nationwide mandatory mask wearing should be instituted. Even simple measures like this would prevent a lot of people being infected. Aid in the form of monetary assistance and food etc should be given to those who are high risk and cannot leave their homes. However, wtf is going to change in \"a few weeks\"  of entire cities like NYC being shut down that's going to make any bit of difference? Are they going to develop a vaccine in a few weeks? No. That may take over a year to get a working vaccine. The reality is that this is being handled the wrong way. If a very small percentage of the population is high risk then those individuals should be keeping themselves away from others as much as possible and for those who can't alternative accommodations should be made or quarantine within certain areas of their home should be instituted. My father stays in his bedroom and I come home and clean and disinfect the house daily. If I should feel ill I would  send him to my sister. But I cannot afford not to work. It is easy for people who can work from home on a computer to say these things. It is unfathomable to me that people believe that this will \"only be a few weeks\".  There are many people who live paycheck to paycheck. Rent is atrociously high in NYC and for many businesses this is an absolute disaster. And it is a disaster for all of the employees who work for these businesses as well. If this is as bad as they say, in \"a few weeks\" when things \"return to normal\" and people go about their lives, unless a dozen new hospitals spring up fully staffed with an enormous amount of equipment, the hospitals and medical community are going to be just as overwhelmed as they would be today.",

And it probably wasn't too much of hated towards you as a drug conviction.  Hell, at least where I work, no one is like \"THESE MOTHER FUCKING DRUG CONVICTION INMATES!\" Lol.  But honestly we've got too many inmates to really know what all of them are in for.  And I'm not going to lie, I'm gonna interact with inmates differently depending on who they are and what they are in for/capable of.  E.g. So you've got 4 inmates that all look about the same and 1 is in for child sex crimes, 1 is in for robbing a convenience store but has a long history of aggravated assault, assault against prison staff, assault against other inmates, and possibly has borderline personality disorder, 1 is in because he was caught for his 2nd drug offense but the DA threw the book at him because everyone knows the dude is way way way more dirty than that and is a Latin King Prince or a Gangster Disciple General but like Al Capone you get em off the street for tax evasion or whatever you can, and then you have that one true \ud83e\udd84 that is actually in for just using drugs.  I call them unicorns because in my 8 years I have seen very very very few people that are locked up for simply using drugs.  They fall more into the category of inmate 3.  That or this one guy who was growing a lot of weed who didn't want to play ball with the DA so he was put away.  But then again that guy is manufacturing, technically even though it's just weed, so he's not really a unicorn either.  Anyways I got off topic.  I hear you man and as long as you stopped being a fuck head after that 18 months you're alright with me.  Hope you took advantage of any drug rehabilitation classes as well as educational classes that were offered.  Cheers and no seriously go wash your hands.  Shits real out there.  Lol",

I\u2019m sorry to say this, but do not expect the COVID-19 pandemic to go away or dissipate for another few weeks or God forbid, another few months. Use caution when going out in public and maintain a safe distance from people regardless of whether they look sickly or not. Remember the coronavirus is asymptomatic meaning you can be infected with it for up to 2 weeks and feel completely fine. By then it could have gained a foothold like a cancerous tumor and become that much harder to treat!\n\nStay safe and we will beat this virus!!",

I'm currently traveling (or trying to, governments keep shutting places down) for spring break with my friends. We live in different parts of the country so if we caught the disease, we could potentially bring it back to our homes (Illinois, California, Washington State).\n\nI feel like the UK thus far has had the only reasoned out response to this crisis. I agree that the restrictions do help flatten the curve, but (pun intended) the UK is ahead of the curve. If we kept the curve flattened for 1.5 years when the vaccine comes out, that would be the best case scenario. But we won't do that. We'll delay the start by one or two months and then when we start work/school/travel again, we'll just be in the exact same boat as we are now. The peak wouldn't be flattened, it would just be pushed down by two months.\n\nAlso there's no guarantee that the \"flattened curve\" will end up below the ceiling of # of hospital beds. We could do all this and still get overwhelmed.\n\nIf we halt all activity for 1.5 years, the economy would collapse and we'd face global starvation. I don't know how to farm, do you?\n\nWhy are we self inflicting such a deep wound to our economy when coronavirus will still be here in a month or two? My friends and I are trying to do our part to keep our economy going, and I think the flatten the curve method is detrimental.\n\nThe cases WILL spike, we just can't keep restrictions up for longer than a couple months, but do you want it to spike AFTER we've crippled our economy or BEFORE.\n\nI think it's imperative that we spread the word to stop 'flattening the curve' now instead of a month from now when we'll be forced to go back to work for economic reasons.",

And why? Because we spent our youth learning how to protect our countrymen and countrywomen from plagues and scourges like COVID-19.\n\nWe have recently lost many gifted nurses, practitioners, physician assistants, physician residents, healthcare workers and attending physicians to COVID-19. Many died with student debt while risking their lives and paying the ultimate sacrifice.\n\nThis is not what we want for America; and this is a small price for America to pay to help show our gratitude and appreciation for those who risk themselves, their families and their loved ones everyday to make sure we feel the love of the US healthcare system. \n\nPlease join us in petitioning the US government to forgive our student loans.

I have many faults but I pride myself on staying calm and scrutinising the information I come across. You don\u2019t have to extrapolate very far to realise that this shit is heading right to the fan. I\u2019m young and healthy, I\u2019ll almost certainly be fine. But I have 4 grandparents in their 80s who are all exceptionally high risk. I have 2 parents in their 60s who are healthy but also statistically close for comfort.\n\nIt is vital that we remain calm but also take this seriously. We succeed when we think about society as a whole: we are all safer if we work as a team. It\u2019s going to get a little ugly but my one takeaway is that a lot of countries right now could do with something to remind us of what unites us, something to pull us together instead of apart. \n\nI hope it goes that direction, because if it goes \u201cevery man for himself\u201d we see probably a lot more fucked.",

Bats and carp don't consort that much in nature. This is being low key censored because it would make the public go ape shit.\n\nEDIT: to add the following excerpt\n\nSARS-CoV-2 were identified in two separate cDNA pools. The first pool was from a Carassius auratus (crusian carp) cell line and the second was from Ctenopharyngodon idella(grass carp) head kidney tissue (6, 7)\n\nTurns out both these samples to the database were submitted from Wuhan.\n\nSo let's examine some of the coincidences so far:\n\n-- a new bat derived coronavirus appears in a market close to the only lab in China known to be working with bat derived corona viruses\n\n-- the new virus has a bizarre genetic overlap with the carp genome\n\n-- the carp genome was submitted by researchers working out of Wuhan\n\n-- the new virus has slight but functionally important genetic similarities to HIV; not a smoking gun, but the only coronavirus with said mutation... but wait! no there is one in nature with this mutation... published Jan 20, after the outbreak started... from researchers working out of -- you guessed it -- Wuhan\n\nI won't explicitly say it, because people get banned and censored for doing so, and more importantly, these days I am happy if I can simply get my aged mother and people like her to avoid gatherings and wear a mask. I don't want to distance myself further from the mainstream narration. There isn't too much to be gained focusing on the origin at this point. That will need to come later though.

It's more like 1% pfft 0% pfft we'll be fine, guyz!!!!! GUYZ!!... \"... Because remember.... Everyone thought it was sudden death upon contraction. Sooo.... Just like a mother comforting a hysterical child awakening from a nightmare.... We would repeat the slogan, \"think of it like a fluuuu\", \"it's not that bad\", \"we'll be fine\", \"we'll be fine\"..... \n\nSo for crying out loud, no-one's telling you to go and lick randrails and bus seats.\n\nIt drives me bananas that people are suddenly acting like they're not panicking, they're just being \"healthy\" and suddenly we're some hippie dippie flippant flu-spreading jerks. That pictograph up there? Grrrrrrr.... All my buttons, lmao\n\nWE'RE THE ORIGINAL - KEEP CALM AND SANITIZE\n\nOWN your hysteria and stop trying to insult your fellow countrymen, just because you feel embarrassed about your initial reaction. Okay, JESSICA? I'm so sick of your shit, Jessica, always starting shit\n\n*no, Lacey, she's always starting some sh.... *\n\nRANT over",

We must solve the overflow problem. \n\nHow many campers are there out there that are just sitting in lots and could be used for this crisis.

Austin cancelled SXSW but waited until literally the day it was starting to announce it. Many attendees had already flown in or paid in full for travel arrangements and lodging and went anyway. Locals then were defiant to make it the last hurrah of returning it back to its former glory before all the corporatism (since those events were cancelled) and are going out in droves as well.\n\nNow this week Austin announces a ban on gatherings of more than 2,500 people but most of its high schools have a larger student enrollment than that and it wasn't addressed. UT has 50k+ students and no announcement made there either.\n\nIt's crazy we know how much better, cost effective and life saving being proactive vs reactive is, but then even the reactive responses are shit.

I was so happy i said \"YESSS!!!!\" He told me we were gonna go get the money in a bathroom stall, so i follow him there. In the bathroom stall he opens up the toilet paper container and pulls out a big wad of cash. \"Theeereee it is\" he says in a happy voice. He gives me 3 dollars, which was quite a lot at the time.

The Obama administration declared swine flu, or H1N1, a public health emergency six weeks before H1N1 was declared a pandemic by the WHO. No H1N1 deaths had yet been recorded in the United States by that time, either. Such a quick response made it possible to create a vaccine quickly. There was no reason to close anything.\n\nThis virus is much easier to pass along, especially since it can live on a surface for days. We are more susceptible to this one, too. It's a new virus, one  that no one has any immunity to, so anyone can catch it, no matter how healthy they are. It has a much longer incubation length before any symptoms show up, as well, which is more important. Someone can catch it, carry it around with them for up to 2 weeks, spreading it to dozens, hundreds, even thousands of other people, depending on where they are and how much they travel. And that's before there are any symptoms, remember, so they have no reason to be more careful.\n\nI know a certain segment are trying to paint the current administration as perfect, and the previous one as terrible, but when you actually compare the facts, they paint a different picture. \n\n[A fact check here ](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/obama-wait-swine-flu-n1h1/)\n[and a fact check here ](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/mar/04/facebook-posts/president-obama-declared-h1n1-public-health-emerge/)\n[and this fact check](https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/trumps-h1n1-swine-flu-pandemic-spin/)\n\n... all show how Obama not only declared a health emergency within 2 weeks of the first outbreak of the H1N1 in the US, and made sure to renew that declaration until it became clear he needed to make it a national emergency. \n\nIt took *this* administration months to declare *anything at all* in response to the Covid-19 outbreak, and during that entire time, before anything was declared, they did nothing helpful at all.",

People themselves are washing their hands more and I see a ton of people on the subway with hand sanitizer, and the city has started to sanitize the subways as well. Merely washing your hands a few times a day reduces the risk of transmission by 45%. Let alone other precautions. \n\nI cant comprehend that an epidemiologist or infectious disease specialist would not know this.",

It includes all specialities from NICU to nursing homes.  I don\u2019t think you can assume that a third of the healthcare force is at work on any given day because it\u2019s not factoring in part time employees.  A lot of nurses who come back to work after having a baby come back part time. I also wonder if it factors in night shift. I work 12 hour shifts in the ICU. I work full time and that\u2019s 3 shifts per week. But there are 14 shifts for me to choose from in a week. My unit has over 100 nurses, I think 120 or so. And we staff for 18 ICU patients at a 1:1 ratio. Some nurses can take 2 patients if they aren\u2019t very critical. Some ICU nurses staff 1:2, and others 1:3 if they are a low acuity ICU. The point being, I don\u2019t know that 6m is a conservative number. Hopefully somebody else can figure out that math better.\n\nAnd while there may be 18m healthcare workers, all 18m aren\u2019t going to be qualified to care for COVID19 patients.  A NICU nurse can\u2019t help out on the adult wards, they aren\u2019t trained to do so. An adult med surg nurse can\u2019t take care of ICU patients, as they aren\u2019t trained either (and training takes months).  We can\u2019t survive without our CNAs who during this will be completely run off of their feet, but they are limited to what they can do in an ICU. \n\nA cursory search shows that there are under 3 million RNs in the country, and less than 1 million ICU nurses. If they start creating more ICU beds in ORs and endoscopy, there will be a limit to how many staff they are going to be able to get.  As for how they will staff their doctors, that\u2019s a total other ball game.  Things need to be entered in the computer in order to get consults, and get medications and such sent. It\u2019s not like overseas where they can just write it down and I can grab it from the med room, make it and give it. The pharmacies in the hospital will get crazily backed up. They need to approve the med, make the med, send the med. They already have it busy as it is. \n\nTLDR:  The HCW number working at a time isn\u2019t an educated guess which could complicate things further.",

New cases in China have greatly decreased since its peak, it's likely that the same will happen in other countries if sufficient mitigation measures are put in place.

Basically it\u2019s using 10 times more of medical power of what you normally would have, and it barely put the city under control. Outside Wuhan the entire country was in self quarantine, even most grocery shopping are done by delivery app/community support delivered to your door. Nobody goes out. The trade off is the spread outside Wuhan is pretty much completely stopped, since nobody is even seeing other people. This though is way more drastic than current Italy.\n\nWhile in Italy, such hard quarantine is harder to be done, and they don\u2019t have the 10 times more medical resources to pull from anywhere to support the current situation. This is also what worries me right now, since China started the lock down to put the spread within one place so the overall health care system is not overloaded, but now in Europe and US the spread is already taking place everywhere, the arrangement of the medical power support that China did is no longer possible. Eventually hospitals in every populated area will be overloaded and nobody can help each other.\n\nTl;dr: Wuhan took 10 times more of doctors it would have to get under control, and rest of China took drastic measure to cut the spread while sending their doctors to Wuhan, but it\u2019s probably too late for the west to do that now\n\nItaly\u2019s number is high, but if other countries don\u2019t take action now, their numbers will be even higher",

I just feel like having schools, restaurants, etc. close down for months is a little overboard and could actually cause more harm than some people getting sick. \nI don\u2019t know, maybe I\u2019m just being an ignorant jackass.

Coronavirus is of similar caliber to viruses we normally experience throughout the year.\n\nCoincidentally, people are experiencing respiratory illnesses associated with, or due to, coronavirus infections. Not so conveniently, this is occurring at the same time as the ramping up of allergy season, while riding the tails of the outgoing flu season simultaneously. We would not normally give any of this a second thought had it not been for SARS infections erroneously labeled as coronavirus; media sensationalism, and mass hysteria can share in the blame for that.\n\nUnless I'm dead wrong, diagnosed cases of caronavirus won't develop a secondary respiratory illness any more likely than any other individual with an active viral infectious process, unless they are immunocompromised (such as HIV, leukemia, or other serious illness) or are not strong enough to fight an infection of any sort to begin with (children, elderly, etc).\n\nThe very same can be said for any other virus. \n\nThus far, numerous hosts have been asymptomatic and showed no signs of illness. Think of the last time you had the sniffles, with it abating on its own without much drama or downtime. \n\nCongratulations, you fought off rhinovirus, but you probably passed it on to a 5 year old child.\n\nStatistically speaking, any virus possesses the capability to cause death. I'm certain most people have forgotten about \"bird flu\" and \"swine flu\" by now, which did prove very lethal, very quickly in many cases. As a reminder of the H1N1pandemic about 10 years ago, here are some data.The following is an excerpt comparing that virus to influenza. It is from a scientific journal titled *CDC estimate of global H1N1 pandemic deaths: 284,000* made available by The Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.\n\n\"The authors say their estimate of 151,700 to 575,400 deaths represents 0.001% to 0.011% of the world population. For comparison, they observe, the WHO estimates that 250,000 to 500,000 people (0.004% to 0.008% of the population) die of seasonal flu annually, and flu deaths in past pandemics ranged from 0.03% of the population in 1968 to 1% to 3% in 1918.\"\n\nThis was not intended to be an attack; I felt the need to explain and elaborate on why I maintain that coronavirus isn't in and of itself something to be freaking out over. \n\nRealistically and statistically speaking, you are more likely to die from influenza alone than you are COVID with SARS. \n\nAt any rate, I hope you and yours remain well, and take whatever precautions you see fit.",

Of course, still do the social distancing, wash hands and be cautious, but let us stop over reacting soon or we will have 60 Million people out of work.",

The panic is unwarranted because it will be endemic and this strain of virus is here to stay. That being said, once it pans out over the next year or two, the real numbers are more than likely going to show more deaths from this than other already existing common cold strains, and probably less deaths from influenza year to year. The problem is that right now, this disease is moving quickly through populations and while the death rate might not actually be that high given how many people will catch it and not need hospitalization, that number is still more than a lot of hospital systems can handle.\n\nIf anything this is highlighting how little people actually care about preventive care for these types of illness in general. All of the advice being given is stuff people should be doing all the time anyways, and nothing about it is novel or unique to this situation.\n\nAdditionally, and I think this point needs stressing, is that in the US the social dynamics of the major at risk group (the elderly, especially those with a chronic health conditions) are vastly different than China and Italy. In China and Italy, the elderly stay at home with family until literally until the very end when they might be taken to a hospital. European countries have nothing similar in general to nursing homes, which provide a buffer for chronically ill elderly people and the general hospital system since most care for non-critical illness can be provided in-situ, relieving hospital beds.\n\nSo this is a complex problem, it definitely doesn't warrant the panic that is being seen in the US, but it definitely is an issue in places where the social system is not well suited for situations like this.",

From severe malnutrition in poor children to 1/3 of the nation being medically obese and having underlying conditions of diabetes 2, heart and kidney conditions, etc. \n\nPreventative health care in this country is pretty much for well-off white-collar workers and the rich. The federal government, especially in the past 20 years, has chopped away at one nutritional and medical program after another. ACA was the only real progress in this century and thank god we've got something in that department.\n\nWe are starting off with an unhealthy population that has learned to only seek health care in an emergency. Japan and South Korea might get off a little easier, with healthier overall populations and a more robust health care system. I think we will see absolutely devastating ICU numbers and mortality rates over these next couple of months, especially in the \"red states\" because they've got the highest percentages of people in poor health and the weakest state safety nets. Keep an eye on Mississippi and Alabama and Louisiana, all of Appalachia, and the exurban areas with nothing but hourly service jobs with no benefits. Racism is going to add to the death toll for everyone, as the southern states in particular are so insanely racist in governing policies that black and brown people are redlined into invisibility. \n\nBut the virus is color blind.",

All it takes is one infected person to come in that day to put everyone at risk the whole day.

My university requires every student to be insured and most copays are $10-30 from my experience.",

Don't get me wrong, I think we are definitely in for it.

We don\u2019t openly cough/sneeze/spit as in Asia and we don\u2019t kiss each other on the cheeks or lips to say hello to friends or family, as much anyway. \n\nAND the lack of panic is *currently* likely keeping mild cases from clogging up hospital admissions, which is a problem in Germany and the hard-hit part of SK at the moment and was in Italy before they started severe triage. This is just slowing things, though, because those mildly-sick folks are still wandering around spreading it. We may well be in for it in two weeks as that check comes due.\n\nEdit: I may be totally wrong, there\u2019s a lot of factors to this thing, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised at all if after-the-fact examination showed that time to peak cases was pretty closely correlated with \u201clikelihood of getting other peoples spit on you, and how often, due to cultural factors\u201d.",

[Today there are almost ten thousand.](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/) If we don't severely reduce or stop the infection rate, we could *easily* hit 50 million cases before 2021. That's how exponential growth works. If the current infection rate continues, we'll be at 100,000 in only ~9 days or so, then 1,000,000 in less than 20 days! You can follow the math from there, but it's possible to hit 50 million infections before tax day, let alone the end of the year. That won't happen because many places are already practicing social distancing and extreme hygiene even though they don't have confirmed cases, but the potential exponential growth exhibited by pandemics should not be minimized or ignored.",

Also noting that the medical community at the time was highly against people doing this, yet political influence drove the town to let the parade happen. By not taking proactive measures, the spanish flu managed to take over cities, states, and countries.\n\nThe reason the spanish flu seems worse is cuz the Coronavirus is still relatively new; we only learned about it in December of 2019. We also HAD the spanish flu to learn what to do and what not to do, and we\u2019re also lucky enough to be alive in a generation where technology and medicine is rapidly improving and we have citizens who are aware of the situation were in. \n\nWe learn history, so we don\u2019t repeat it. That\u2019s why these social distancing measures are taken because without a vaccine or antiviral to cure this thing, it\u2019s the best thing we can do to prevent the spread.\n\n\u201cOnly matters to you.\u201d Do you not realize this is a global pandemic? Do you not realize countries are shutting down borders and going into lock down for a reason? You\u2019re right, people are dying because of all those terrible things.

Rather, a lot of people are desensitized or ignore the real dangers in the world that the media reports.  Hurricanes are a great example of this.  Hurricane Dorian was a major category 5 hurricane that was tracking to directly hit Florida's east coast with winds as high in speed as 200 MPH.  Florida was helped in the 11th hour by steering currents that brought the storm north and east away from the peninsula.  The Bahamas on the other hand?  Not so fortunate, they suffered one of the worst natural disasters in their and the world's history.\n\nNow, how did/have most Floridians reacted to Dorian's aftermath?  Basically by saying that it was a lot of overblown media hype.  \"It didn't actually hit us, so the news just kept making up a bunch of malarkey to scare us.\"  The Bahamas are literally still in ruins and the attitude of most of the people who were very much in the crosshairs of that devastating storm believe that the media made too much of it.  And no, it's not a case of \"Florida man\" being crazy, it's complacency, and it happens to all people all the time.

Hell, this exact type of outbreak was predicted by numerous experts both in the U.S. and globally.  Yet it was still exacerbated by wildly irresponsible decision making (disbanding the NSC pandemic response team) and disturbing levels of inaction (lack of testing) on the part of world leaders.\n\nThe media is not the boy who cried wolf, there are real actual dangers in the world and instead of taking them seriously, most people prefer to ignore them in the hopes that they won't actually have to confront them.",

And the tests we DO have aren't even very good tests, since we turned down the offer of (better quality) test kits from the WHO. \n\nNot only that, some can have the disease and think they just have the common cold, and spread the disease to dozens or hundreds more, because they don't think this is real, and they wander around out and about, coughing and sneezing on things other people will have to touch. \n\nThis is not a drill. This is not a hoax. This is not the common cold, or even a normal influenza. There are literally requests for people to make masks (with 3D printers, or even with sewing machines!) and donate them to hospitals! Hospitals are reusing one-use masks! This is NOT acting irrationally. This is a true emergency.",

Bit worried as at the moment I\u2019m very mucusy and can\u2019t get it up so i\u2019m using my clenil but apparently the use of the steroid inhalers is working against people with the virus because although the virus causes the immune system to go into overdrive and kill virus + healthy cells, the steroids work to stop the immune response so we don\u2019t get an attack. Apparently when it is used for 2-3 weeks during the virus it causes it to be very severe.\n\n But they also recommend continuing it if you have it.\n\nSo I really am just not sure what I\u2019m doing atm. If I take it i\u2019m less immune so could catch it easier..bjt would be comfortable before I get it. If I don\u2019t take it..asthma attacks will be bad and the mucus will be bad enough I can\u2019t breathe anyway and then if i get it I will still not be able to breathe.\n\nEither way if I get it and survive I will probably have honeycomb lung and fibrosis so will have a lifetime of more severe lung problems.\n\nEDIT: Also just found this so i\u2019m happy now. \n\nI have asthma, what should I do?\nAsthma UK's advice is to keep taking your preventer inhaler (usually brown) daily as prescribed. This will help cut your risk of an asthma attack being triggered by any respiratory virus, including coronavirus.\nCarry your blue reliever inhaler with you every day, in case you feel your asthma symptoms flaring up. If your asthma is getting worse and there is a risk you might have coronavirus, contact the online NHS 111 coronavirus service.",

Almost positive it was COVID19 but since it was before the CDC started sending out test kits it wasn\u2019t confirmed. \n\nIt was brutal and I\u2019m still coughing up the last of the sputum but I got through it at home with just DayQuil and a course of oral antibiotics to handle secondary infection concerns. There was a few nights where the cough and wheezing got bad enough that I considered going to the hospital but my rescue inhaler was sufficient to prevent/treat an attack. \n\nIt\u2019s definitely worse than the flu, I caught both strains of the flu a few years ago when there was vaccine shortage and it was miserable and I ended up in the hospital for a couple days. This last virus was worse, the flu was terrible for a few days but it cleared up pretty quickly after those few days and the effects didn\u2019t linger.\n\nThis other virus I just had which I\u2019m almost positive was COVID-19 was a 5+ week endeavor. Starts off feeling like a cold, then a bad cold, then the flu symptoms start, then severe flu symptoms transition into an upper respiratory infection, then into what feels like bronchitis with a productive cough. Which is miserable but it strangely seemed to come is phases where you would think you were getting better for half a day and then the next stage would start with the last stages symptoms clearing up in the first day or so of the new phase. It was more like having multiple difference viruses back to back as opposed to one virus that has symptoms that add on over time but clear up all at once.\n\nDo everything you can to avoid it but I just wanted to share in case anyone else out there that has lung disease as is terrified. I obviously can\u2019t speak to the statistics for overall mortality rate among people with lung disease but I can say that it\u2019s possible to get though it. I am in decent shape but nowhere near healthy and I did at home with flu meds, chicken soup, lots of fluids, and rest whenever possible.\n\nIt\u2019s dangerous as hell for people with ling disease but It isn\u2019t guaranteed hospitalization and death. Which is exactly what I was terrified of since so little is known about it and even older people with healthy lungs are dying. It seems like there are other factors besides pre existing lung disease at play, seems like mainly age, in determining who develops the severe viral pneumonia that ends up killing you. Shit, the colonized infections in the lungs of people with CF and severe asthma might even work to mitigate the viral pneumonia risk since the bacteria may outcompete the virus. Then as long as you get through the secondary bacterial infection you bypass the biggest risk of the virus. Sucks either way but at least you have antibiotics to treat the colonized infections when there is no direct treatment for viral pneumonia.",

The severe reactions to steroids seem to be from oral steroids which are typically a treatment for bronchitis or severe asthma exacerbation. Basically, they tried giving severe/critical patients oral steroids and it made things worse. There isn't going to be any real guidance on the inhaled corticosteroids you're probably taking to control your asthma. Keep in mind, ICS treatment is targeted to the lungs and doesn't suppress your immune system in general. It just controls inflammation of the airway. Your immune system is going to recruit a ton of T cells that are unaffected by the steroid inhaler if you do get sick.\n\nBut if you can't breathe without taking your steroid inhaler you need to keep taking it. Also, you should get a pneumovax23 shot if you haven't already to protect against secondary bacterial infections. I'm going to add now that people seem to be reading and upvoting this post that the pneumovax23 vaccine is for certain at-risk individuals between the ages of 19 and 64 including asthmatics and people who smoke cigarettes. Full guidance available here: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/pneumo/downloads/pneumo-vaccine-timing.pdf. And if we read the header and check the current CDC recommendations (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis-statements/ppv.html), they have actually expanded the age range to 2-64, meaning this vaccine is safe and approved now for children.

Lyme disease and TB have had reported reinfection cases in the past, granted I agree, reinfection does seem very implausible, but we haven\u2019t had enough time to assess that. Right now, it\u2019s best think worst-case-scenario and stay alert through this so we can prevent these numbers from going up. Just yesterday we had 19,000 new cases reported in the US alone, and as I\u2019m typing this there are over 12,000 today. We\u2019re literally moving up these numbers by the ten thousands of people.\n\n\u201cThe disease is going to spread no matter how far away you stay from people.\u201d You ask if I understand how diseases work, which I will admit I\u2019m not fully aware sure, but do you understand how people get infected? There\u2019s a reason they tell you to wipe down surfaces, wash your hands, and keep a distance of 6ft between people, because they know how this thing spreads. Do you think someone will magically get the virus if they stay home, disinfect their areas, and stay away from all the people that are infected?\n\nI also agree, abuse and starvation may never leave, this disease will. THATS THE GOAL. We\u2019re social distancing so we can get rid of this disease/pandemic entirely.\n\nAnd you\u2019re right, those things are huge issues. But the means of solving them aren\u2019t plausible if these infections are going to get those people before we can give them the help that they need. Yes, social distancing is absolutely destroying our economy and overlooking terrible things that are happening in the world. At the same time, we\u2019re taking these preventive measures, so we can go back to taking care of those important issues. Because currently, the virus is so rapidly spreading and claiming so many lives that even taking care of those things, could amount to nothing if people keep getting infected and die, especially for the poor, less-privileged, elderly, people who are sick, or people who have underlying conditions, who are more likely to die from this disease.\n\nIt\u2019s not overreaction, it\u2019s proactive measures to prevent worse things from happening in the future, so that we can go back and focus on those real issues that matter. Please don\u2019t type stuff like \u201cit\u2019s whatever\u201d if you\u2019re just trying to get a rise out of people. We\u2019re all in this together and it\u2019s almost a moral duty to do our part and prevent these infections from spreading.",

Coronavirus? Studies show 1.4% to 2.3%. Despite the difference, that is a heck of a lot higher than the flu - 14 to 23 times the fatality rate. \n\nIt is not \u2018simply another version of the flu\u2019.

This will help cut your risk of an asthma attack being triggered by any respiratory virus, including coronavirus.\nCarry your blue reliever inhaler with you every day, in case you feel your asthma symptoms flaring up. If your asthma is getting worse and there is a risk you might have coronavirus, contact the online NHS 111 coronavirus service.",

From that article:\n> \u201cAnd [asymptomatic cases are] definitely not a major driver of transmission.\u201d\n\nThere are, however, other causes for concern:\n> There have been a number of studies that suggest Covid-19 patients may shed virus in stool or from their throats for some time after they\u2019ve recovered. That naturally raises concerns about whether they are still infectious.",

Being a dick also doesn't help in jnforming people. Do you want to be right, or do you want to inform? I think the first one. But whatever, lets continue the discussion.\n\nIm not talking absolute numbers, I'm talking relative numbers. Relatively, the spread seems to be slightly faster than seasonal flu, but to no \"factor gazillion\" extremes at all (one person infecting 2-3 people with corona in relation to one person infecting 1-2 people with seasonal flu). Considering that we have immunity against the seasonal flu and not against corona, this is nothing weird or extreme or whatsoever.\n\nThe mortality rate, relatively speaking, seems to be higher, but known numbers vary greatly per region, leading us to not really know the accurate rates. However, with data available at this point its estimated somewhere around 3.4%. This is indeed quite a lot deadlier than seasonal flu, but chances are big this number will be corrected big time in hindsight (as happens with most epidemics/pandemics). Many countries (Italy, for example) register their deaths way better than their total infections, so the mortality rate ends up rather high than low in relation to reality. While others (like South Korea) has tested really well and found way more infected cases, but not more deaths, leading to much lower mortality rate.\n\nSo yeah, the attention it gets is probably a good thing. But according to what we know to this date, there is no reason for all the extreme pandemic we-could-all-die doomscenario panic that I encounter around the internet, as the actual results of this virus isn't anything extreme.",

Its important to recognize that you can't ever save everyone (death is something that happens to all of us) so you shouldn't waste resources trying to save someone who is not saveable. We must be good stewards of resources and not waste them on intubating a 97 y.o. or keeping people on ventilators waiting to die for weeks while they're family arrives. There's no panels making those decisions and it is not based on money or who can pay either.",

How would punishing someone who *knowingly* spreads HIV to an HIV negative person (without their knowledge) stop people from getting tested? If you have HIV and your partner knows, then I don't believe you should be punished--it's consensual. But spreading HIV to your partner without them (your partner) knowing you have HIV is something that should be punished. It's honestly on the same level as rape in my opinion. \n\nLook at Japan--they are jailing people up to a year for reselling their mask for profit because of COVID. It's pretty much the same thing. It needs to be punishable.",

Nonetheless, despite whether you feel the symptoms or not, if you are ill you are spreading the virus. Sure, you will be fine, but 20 some other people you interact with (or they infect after catching it up from you) as a consequence, won\u2019t.\n\nHence, as the decease has proven itself to be lethal (and by a large amount of dead bodies), isolating/social distancing is a priority.\n\nThink of the cases: \n\n1- You are healthy. Therefore, don\u2019t risk getting it by going to some public gatherings/places.\n\n2- You are not healthy, but clueless, as you show no symptoms. Hence, don\u2019t spread the decease\n\n3 - You are ill + symptoms. That is when quarantine is required the most, duh.\n\nThe difference between 1&2 and 3 cases is that you can\u2019t be 100% sure that you are not infected in case 1&2 but you are fairly certain you are ill in case 3. \n\nHence, even if you feel no symptoms, the best course of actions is not to risk getting it yourself or helping it spread (again, you have no clue which one is your case without testing often). \n\nWhat OP was stating is that isolating only if you are ill is simply not enough. When you are ill, it is too late for you + you don\u2019t want to make others ill. Thereby, it is fairly obvious that you would quarantine self anyway. \n\nHowever, he is emphasizing that a message similar to \u201cALL must take precautions and stay safe, regardless whether you are ill or not\u201d would be more accurate and applicable to the current situation.",

But that means some personal sacrifice for the greater good, like working out at home. But based on all the masks, water, and toilet paper that's getting bought up, leaving nothing for anybody else, sacrifice for others isn't really our strong suit. It's a tragedy of the commons scenario. And the differences between the two realistic scenarios you posited, there's one where out of the 331 million people, you don't come into contact with it.

We ALL pay for each of those \"free\" things, with this thing called taxes. Even if we don't drive, or never visit a park, we pay for it. And that is the exact same way we would pay for healthcare. And we would get a better deal on pricing, too, because it would cover *everyone.* Just like *everyone* is allowed to visit a park, or drive on a road. It's exactly the same. It's free to use as often as we want, because we all pay the same for it, long before we use it. Why your type can't understand it is beyond me, since you drive on those free roads all the time.\n\nAs for this illness, and what it will do to our nation, it's funny how Congress magically *found* several billion dollars to dump into the economy to help us make it through the outbreak. And they are working on yet another bill that would magically find several more billion (or even several trillion) to help us all. That is also \"free\" stuff for us to have. Bet you won't turn down your \"free\" check to help you through the quarantine!",

I've had complex health issues for a while, never pneumonia though. I have had a lot of trouble breathing recently, asthma/allergies triggered by extreme smoke/hazardous air quality for a long period, and that was hard enough.\n\n I did watch my sweet little dog die from pneumonia less than a year ago, and it still breaks my heart. It was a complication of a failing heart (genetic heart issues) and we'd had her on preventative meds for a while, but knew that would probably just delay things. When she got pneumonia we did *everything* we could, medications to reduce the fluid in her lungs, making sure she was still eating & drinking water, had to leave her with the vet a couple times for monitoring and draining the fluid to see if she'd get any better. And in the middle of it, she had a few days where she seemed ok, back to her old self & jumping around on the furniture. But you feel so helpless while watching anyone, even a pet, drown from inside their lungs and you can't really do anything else to help. \n\nSo it gets to me when people assume pneumonia isn't a big deal. It can be mild, or it could be a slow, heart wrenching way to die. And I wouldn't wish that on anyone.",
